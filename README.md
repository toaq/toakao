# Toakao

This is a project of modular Toaq dictionary, aiming to be a complement for [the official dictionary](https://github.com/toaq/dictionary/blob/master/dictionary.json) and the [Toadua](https://toadua.uakci.space/) collaborative dictionary for the Toaq language.

* `toakao.json` contains all community and official definitions, it is automatically generated with the `update.py` script.
* `toakao_extended.json` contains the same data except for some additional data automatically fetched from [Predilex](https://github.com/Ntsekees/Predilex/), such as semantic categorization tags and corresponding lemmas in various languages. Since this file is automatically generated, it should not be manually edited.

There is [a web dictionary interface](https://toaq.net/toakao/browser/) for browsing the Toakao dataset.
